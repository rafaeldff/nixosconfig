# nixosconfig
My personal nixos configuration files

## How To
Kind of hacky for now, will improve it later.

Create the following files replacing WORKSTATION for your chosen name:
 - configuration-WORKSTATION.nix
 - custom-WORKSTATION.nix

You can use the existing `configuration-mac.nix` and `custom-mac.nix` as a base.

To install the files onto your machine, run `install.sh WORKSTATION` as root.
